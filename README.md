# Responsive Portfolio

The project displays a personal portfolio with 3 pages. Each page should be mobile responsive. 

# Pages
 - About: The about page acts as the homepage. It has a picture and small bio to introduce the portfolio.
 
 - Portfolio: The portfolio page displays a gallery of images. Each image is overlayed with a link that will, at a later date, take you to 
   a completed project.
   
 - Contact: The contact page has a contact form that takes a name, email, and message.
